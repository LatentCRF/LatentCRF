## Overview

LatentCRF is a plug-in module that can be used for image generative tasks. 
Its architecture is motivated from priors about the natural image distribution
used in conditional random fields. In this repository, we present basic code 
blocks to use the LatentCRF module. 

Additionally, we provide code used for some of the diversity evaluations 
in the LatentCRF paper.  


## LatentCRF Module
Coming soon ...



## Diversity Evaluations
See `eval_diversity` directory for code relevant to this. Example scripts for four 
models (from HuggingFace) are available. Run as follows:

```bash
python sdxl_turbo.py
```
